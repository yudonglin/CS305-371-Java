a. Which hash function are you using? and where did you get the hash function from?
(Cite the reference).

I started with the first String hashing method presented during the class, in which you simply add up the ASCII values
of all characters of the key. However, I notice that such a method will result in a high collision due to input data
size and the average length of the key. However, by adding the square of the ASCII values, I was able to obtain a much
better result. Furthermore, by experimenting with some crazy ideas, I am also able to continue decreasing my collision
counts by adding the length of the key left shift by one, which is inspired by the second String hashing method (Cyclic
shift code) discussed during the lecture.
Do keep in mind that due to the nature of this assignment, my hashing method is designed to make the words better
distributed throughout the table. It also makes it easier for words with the same character combination to be hashed on
the same spot.


b. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Hashing? Give one application of
Hashing and give details about that application.

Other than the fact that hashing can be used to insert the item into a table, you can also use hashing function to
verify data integrity. SHA256 is a typical example of such an application. In general, a file is a bunch of zero and one.
To ensure a file (especially a huge one) is transferred or downloaded correctly, you can use the hashing function to
generate a hashing code and compare it with the hashing code generated by the server on the same file to find out whether
any data is corrupted. If the file is not correctly downloaded, the hashing codes will differ. As a game developer, I
also use the hashing function to ensure that the game files are not modified by the players for cheating purposes.


c. Amount of time you spent on implementing the assignment. Challenges you faced
while implementing the assignment? How did you overcome these challenges?

I spent around 10 hours on this assignment. One of the biggest challenges I have to face is figuring out an effective
method to hash the key. In the end, I overcome these challenges by reading the textbook, reviewing lectures,
brainstorming, and doing tons of experiments.
